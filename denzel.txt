You’ve invested a lot in your education, and people have invested in you. And let me tell you
the world needs your talents, and does it ever? The world needs a lot and we need it from you.
We really do. We need it from you, young people.
I mean, I’m not speaking for the rest of us up here, but I know I’m getting a little grayer. We
need it from you, the young people, because remember this: you’ve got to get out there, and
you got to give it everything you got. Whether it's your time, your talent, your prayers, or your
treasures. Because remember this: you will never see a u-haul behind a hearse. I’ll say it
again: You will never see a u-haul behind a hearse. The Egyptians tried it—and all they got was
robbed!
